**OnsenUI Demo** is a demo theme for WP-AppKit based on the Onsen UI framework. WP-AppKit is a WordPress plugin to create mobile apps connected to WordPress (more on that at http://getwpappkit.com).

# Installation

* Download WP-AppKit: [https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit/releases](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit/releases)
* Install WP-AppKit as you would do for any other WordPress plugins (ie. drop the plugin folder in */wp-content/plugins*)
* Activate WP-AppKit using the _Plugins_ WordPress admin panel. (Browse the *Installed Plugins* list and click the *Activate* link of WP-AppKit.)
* Now you should have a brand new */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit* folder (yes, this is where app themes are stored)
* Download the theme from [this repository](https://github.com/mleroi/wpak-theme-onsenui) and drop its folder in */wp-content/themes-wp-appkit*
* In WordPress, use the *WP-AppKit* admin panel to create a new app and choose one of the themes in the *Appearance* box
* From there you're free to test in your browser (using the Chrome's Emulation Mode) or directly try to compile
